%My research goal is understanding how knowledge emerges and develops by replicating these processes in machines. Arguably, the most fundamental source of human knowledge lies in perception\footnote{\url{https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/\#SourKnowJust}}, which forms the basis of how we interpret and learn from the world around us. To reflect this, my current focus is on multimodal artificial intelligence, where I explore challenges that arise from introducing multimodal inputs and outputs to large language models (LLMs). 

My research centers on multimodal understanding and generation, with a particular focus on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). I explore how multimodal context and text can be more effectively connected in AI systems, spanning both architectural innovations and evaluative methodologies.
