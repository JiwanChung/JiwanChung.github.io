This is my new blog where I'll share thoughts on research, technology, and other topics that interest me.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- **Research insights** - Thoughts on multimodal learning, MLLMs, and AI research
- **Technical tutorials** - Practical guides and code walkthroughs
- **Paper summaries** - Notes on interesting papers I've read

## Stay Tuned

More posts coming soon!
